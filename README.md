## Сustomization adding your own component

To add your component, you need the following:

1. Publish assets with the command -
```
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag="moonshine-editorjs-assets"
```
2. In the file - /resources/views/vendor/moonshine-editorjs/fields/editorJs.blade.php there is an example of creating your own component
   , you must either uncomment it or change it for yourself. You can also use the vite and create your own class, and
   you also need to connect your own js and css. But you need to keep in mind that connecting your component takes place in this way.
```
    editorJsConf.custom = {
        customImage: {
            class: SimpleImage,
            inlineToolbar: true
        }
   };
```
Using the js css connection method is at the discretion of the developer
